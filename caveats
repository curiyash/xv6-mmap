- length in mmap parameter is used as an explicit understanding of number of bytes of the last page to be written back to the file
- I had 2 choices in deciding what to do with maps across fork
    - page fault and accordingly get the code in each child and fork
    - If page fault occurs before fork and in parent, then it is directly accessible in child process (does not involve a page fault)

    - I chose 1st because that seems to be more space conservative and fits naturally into the flow of the code
- Daemons won't work well with MAP_PRIVATE
    - As soon as parent is gone, page is gone
    - There is no reference count as well
    - We will have to copyVMA instead
